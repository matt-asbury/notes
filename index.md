# A Collection of Notes

I have the memory of a particularly forgetful fish. I read a lot and consume, in my opinion, a lot of content that is useful in my professional life. There are times when I read or listen to something and then my brain does this weird thing where it'll store that information away in a place that I can't easily access. Time will pass and then I'll be having a conversation and something will be mentioned that will trigger my brain to extract a whole bunch of information I didn't know I had and present it as if it was always there. I don't think my brain likes me.

In an effort to correct this, or at least make that information easier to access at a later date when I inevitably remember it, I decided to note what I've read or heard in an accessible way. Consider this place an external hard drive for my head. Feel free to download things from it.

It is somewhat limited but will expand over time... unless I forget...
