## Organisations

Organisational design gets the right people in the right places, empowers them to make decisions, and then holds them accountable for their results. Maintained consistently and changed sparingly, nothing else will help you scale more.

An organisation is a collection of people working toward a shared goal.

All organisations work, just some better than others. All organisations create energy: some create heat through friction, frustration and politics; few create momentum.

To solve a problem quickly, think about process design. To solve a problem permanently when you have time, evolve the culture. If the process is weak and culture too slow, that's where organisation design lives.

### Sizing Teams

**Managers should support between 6-8 engineers** - This gives them enough time for active coaching, coordinating, strategising, leading change, etc. Less than 4 engineers and managers operate as tech leads. More than 8-9 engineers and managers operate as coaches and little else effectively.

**Managers of managers should support 4-6 managers** - This gives them enough time to coach, align with stakeholders and invest in their organisations.

**On-call rotations requires 8 engineers** - Teams should own their whole domain and it requires 8 engineers to effetcively support that domain on-call.

**Teams of less than 4 are not teams** - There are too few people that holiday, sickness, departures, etc. causing significant disruption.

**Keep innovation and maintenance together** - Having separate teams may seem sensible but you create a "class" system of innovators and maintainers.

**Guiding Principles**

- Teams should be 6-8 people
- To create a new team, grow an existing team to 8-10 and then split into two
- Never create empty teams
- Never leave managers supporting more than 8 people
